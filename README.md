## Namrata Narain

Hello! I am a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow for Professor Claudia Goldin at the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Harvard University Department of Economics. 

I am interested in labor economics of the [Kremer-Kaur variety](http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_events/17/self-control_at_work.pdf). What makes workers productive? How binding are contracts on human behavior? Why do so few women in India [work](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/07/05/why-india-needs-women-to-work)? How do workers find [jobs](http://www.surveyor.nber.org/home/harvard/library/MontgomeryAER.pdf)? Can lower skilled workers be trained effectively to get and maintain good [jobs](http://www.surveyor.nber.org/home/harvard/library/MontgomeryAER.pdf)? Might the lower outcomes for minorities be driven by worker _worker_ [discrimination](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/two-sided_discrimination.pdf)? More generally, I am interested in the origin and evolution of [culture](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11986331/nunn-slave-trade.pdf?sequence=1) and [institutions](https://economics.mit.edu/files/4469).
