Hello! I am a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow for Professor Claudia Goldin at the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Harvard University Department of Economics. 

I am interested in labor economics of the [Kremer-Kaur variety](http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_events/17/self-control_at_work.pdf). What makes workers productive? How binding are contracts on human behavior? Why do so few women in India [work](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/07/05/why-india-needs-women-to-work)? How do workers find [jobs](http://www.surveyor.nber.org/home/harvard/library/MontgomeryAER.pdf)? Can lower skilled workers be trained effectively to get and maintain good [jobs](http://www.surveyor.nber.org/home/harvard/library/MontgomeryAER.pdf)? Might the lower outcomes for minorities be driven by _worker_ [discrimination](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/two-sided_discrimination.pdf)? Do workers work harder in response to higher [wages](https://faculty.smu.edu/millimet/classes/eco7321/papers/fehr%20goette.pdf)? Can we measure how workers value their [time](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23906)? Does a worker's quality of work depend on her [workplace](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/959771468000899235/Quality-and-accountability-in-healthcare-delivery-audit-evidence-from-primary-care-providers-in-India)?

More generally, I am interested in the origin and evolution of [culture](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11986331/nunn-slave-trade.pdf?sequence=1) and [institutions](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24798.pdf).
