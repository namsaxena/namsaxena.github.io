Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at Harvard University and a Non-Resident Tutor at Dunster House. 

My fields of interest are Public Finance, Macro Economics, Theory, and Labor. 

I am a Graduate Student Affiliate at Opportunity Insights for 2019-2020 and an Emergent Ventures Grant recipient.


### Background

I studied Applied Mathematics at Harvard University and graduated _cum laude_ in 2015. Post undergrad, I went to the London School of Economics and got my M.Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics in 2016 (alumni profile [here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/study/taught-masters/msc-alumni-profiles)). From June 2016 to February 2018, I worked at the [Education Innovation Laboratory](https://edlabs.harvard.edu/) at Harvard and from March 2018 to August 2019, I was a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research for Professor Claudia Goldin.
